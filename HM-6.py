Hometask 06. comprehensions

Task description
create list that will store such values
list_target = [(1,1), (3,4), (5,5), (7,0)]
zero (0) is our default value that we set if no such element
by index was found in certain list. Ð¡ode should work and vise versa
ex. l1=[1,4,5] l2=[1,3,5,7] input data should produce
list_target = [(1,1), (4,3), (5,5), (0,7)]
your solution should include comprehension constructions

Advices:
set of (list1 indexes union list2 indexes) could be helpful
to get larger indexes scope ( or use if-else)
dict as you remember has default value if key was not found d1.get(key, 0)
